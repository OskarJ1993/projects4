## Description

  The decision to build a tire shop e-commerce website as my University Course Project was fueled by several factors, all of which contributed to a meaningful and enriching learning experience. My motivation stemmed from the desire to create a practical and real-world application that would not only challenge me technically but also have a tangible impact on potential users.

Practical Application: Building an e-commerce website for a tire shop offered a practical use case. It allowed me to apply the concepts I learned in my university courses to a real-world scenario, giving me a deeper understanding of web development and how it impacts businesses and customers.

Industry Relevance: E-commerce is a rapidly growing industry, and having hands-on experience in building an online store was highly relevant to current market trends. This project provided me with invaluable insights into the complexities of running an online retail business and the technology required to make it successful.

User-Centric Focus: Creating a tire shop website offered me the opportunity to address user needs and provide a seamless shopping experience. Understanding customer behavior, designing intuitive interfaces, and optimizing the website for various devices were essential aspects of this project.

Technical Challenge: Implementing an e-commerce platform involved a wide range of technical challenges, such as handling product catalogs, managing user accounts, processing payments securely, and ensuring data integrity. Tackling these challenges improved my coding skills and expanded my knowledge of Python, Django, and web development best practices.

Learning by Doing: While theoretical knowledge is essential, I believe that hands-on experience is crucial for deeper learning. Building this project allowed me to reinforce my understanding of Django, web frameworks, database management, and version control systems like Git.

What I Learned:

Throughout the process of building the tire shop e-commerce website, I gained invaluable skills and knowledge that I can apply in my future career as a developer. Here are some of the key lessons I learned:

Django Framework: I honed my skills in Django, a powerful web framework that streamlines the development of web applications. I learned how to build robust, scalable, and maintainable applications using Django's built-in functionalities and third-party packages.

Database Management: I gained hands-on experience in designing and managing a database for an e-commerce platform. I learned how to create efficient database models, perform database migrations, and ensure data integrity.

Front-End Development: Working on the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) taught me the importance of responsive design, accessibility, and user interaction. I gained expertise in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance the website's visual appeal and usability.



Version Control: Utilizing Git for version control helped me collaborate effectively with my project team and manage code changes efficiently.

Project Management: Throughout the development process, I improved my project management skills, such as time estimation, task prioritization, and regular progress tracking.

Debugging and Troubleshooting: Building a complex web application exposed me to various debugging techniques, allowing me to identify and resolve issues efficiently.

In conclusion, building the tire shop e-commerce website for my university course project was a rewarding journey. The project enriched my technical skill set, enhanced my problem-solving abilities, and deepened my passion for web development. The experience has inspired me to continue exploring new technologies and challenges in the field of software development. I am excited to apply the knowledge gained from this project to future endeavors and contribute to the ever-evolving world of web technologies.

## Installation

Install Visual Studio Code:
If you haven't already installed VS Code, download it from the official website: https://code.visualstudio.com/. Choose the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and follow the installation instructions.

Open Your Django Project Folder:
Open VS Code and navigate to your Django project folder by selecting "File" > "Open Folder" from the top menu. Choose the folder where your Django project is located.

Install Python Extension:
In VS Code, go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window (or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X on macOS). Search for "Python" in the Extensions view, and install the official Python extension provided by Microsoft.

Create Virtual Environment (Optional):
It's good practice to work in a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. If you haven't created a virtual environment for your Django project, you can do so using venv or virtualenv. Open the terminal within VS Code (Terminal > New Terminal), navigate to your project folder, and run:

bash

# Using venv (Python 3.3+)
python -m venv env

# Using virtualenv
virtualenv env
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux: source env/bin/activate
Install Django and Dependencies:
With the virtual environment activated, install Django and any other required dependencies. Run the following command in the terminal:


pip install django
If you have a requirements.txt file containing all the project dependencies, you can install them using:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Django Project in VS Code:
Ensure that your Django project is configured correctly in VS Code. Open the settings (File > Preferences > Settings) and search for "python.pythonpath". Set it to point to the Python interpreter within your virtual environment. For example:


"python.pythonPath": "path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/python"
Replace "path/to/your/virtualenv" with the path to your virtual environment.

Create Debug Configuration:
To run your Django project from within VS Code, you need to create a debug configuration. Click on the Run icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window (or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+D or Cmd+Shift+D on macOS). Click on the gear icon to create a launch configuration. Choose "Django" as the environment and provide the necessary settings (e.g., "name": "Python: Django", "python": "${config:python.pythonPath}", "request": "launch", "program": "path/to/manage.py", "args": ["runserver"], "django": true).

Start Debugging:
With the debug configuration set up, click on the green "Play" button to start debugging. This will run the Django development server, and you can access your project in the browser at the specified address (usually http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

You are now set up to run your Django project in VS Code! You can set breakpoints in your code for debugging and take advantage of the various features offered by VS Code to streamline your development process.
